#Shopping is an intrinsic part of everyday life. The purpose of creating shopping lists is to efficiently manage time and resources while shopping and not forget something important to buy. These shopping lists could range from grocery shopping to shopping for clothes, accessories, jewelry, gifts for special occasions, etc. The paper-pen-based approach is no longer the only effective means of creating shopping lists.
With the advent of the mobile phone era and the frequent use of mobile apps to perform everyday tasks, the trend to use apps for creating and managing shopping lists is becoming more popular by the day. There are hundreds of “Shopping List” apps for both Android phones and iPhones. Also, the design of the mobile app interface contributes a significant share of human-computer interaction (HCI) research. The goal of this paper is to study the transformation from the paper-pen-based approach to the mobile app approach, analyze the user experience with the most popular shopping list apps for both Android and iPhone; and suggest new ways to improve this experience both in terms of usability of app and user interface improvements.
Before going to the grocery, it is very important to list the things you need to buy. You don't want to end up purchasing goods in the grocery and later realize that you forgot an item or two. Making a list can also help you sort out and prioritize the items you need to buy.
